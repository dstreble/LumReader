Description: This package estimates the detection windows of a TL/OSL reader based on the filters and the PMT selected. It also allows to check if the stimulation unit do not overlap with this detection windows. Finally, for those only interested by filter combination, it could provide the transmission property of a filter stack. The user can used the filters, PMT and stimulation unit already includes in the package or creates its own.
